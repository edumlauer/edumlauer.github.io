Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a Unity Game Developer with over 6 years of experience. Currently Iâ€™m working as a freelancer, check the [Projects](./projects) page to see what I have worked on.

I love what I do, and I work to deliver great products and solutions. Iâ€™m always looking for new technologies and techniques that can bring something new or improve current processes.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been learning how to play Dwarf Fortress and getting into science-fiction novels. I also have been practicing and expanding my knowledge of game design and experimenting with Unity DOTS.
