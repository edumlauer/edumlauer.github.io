WebGL application used for quality assurance of 3D models. Users can inspect the modelâ€™s topology, UV mapping, materials, and other aspects. Annotations are created in the model by QA inspectors and can be visualized by the modeler. Application is super lightweight and optimized, makes use of glTF for importing 3D models at runtime.
