A puzzle game where the player has to fill all the empty cubes.
- Level editor that can publish puzzles online;
- Puzzle rating and custom leaderboards;
- Custom system for multiple languages support;
- IAP and ads, after watching an optional rewarded video ad the game tells the player how to solve 33% of the puzzle;
- Share puzzles in any social media and challenge your friends;

The game has a RESTful web service developed in Java where the puzzles and analytical data are persisted in a PostgreSQL database.

A [WebGL version](https://dupyx.com/cube-filler/) is also available without some features. It's optimized for a small build size and fast loading. The intention was to convert players to the mobile version. The game is available in a wide range of gaming portals.
