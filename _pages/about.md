HiðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a Unity Game Developer with over 5 years of experience. I graduated in System Analysis and Development in 2016. During this period I studied Computer Engineering in Canada for one year with a scholarship.

Currently, Iâ€™m working as a freelancer. Check the [Projects](./projects) page to see what I have worked on.

I love what I do, and work to deliver great products and solutions. Iâ€™m always looking for new technologies and techniques that can bring something new or improve current processes.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been learning how to play Dwarf Fortress and getting into science-fiction novels, starting with Dune. Also been practicing and expanding my knowledge with game design and experimenting with Unity DOTS.
